      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>
        We are located in Nairobi, Kenya along Moi Avenue. Being an official
        Nike partner, we sell their shoes at convenient prices. We focus on
        team-designed collaborations that appeal to our global community of
        global independents, creatives, and free-thinkers. We create shoes to
        reflect the unbound lives we live and don't stop until we get it right.
      </p>
      <h2>Mission</h2>
      <p>
        Our mission is what drives us to do everything possible to expand human
        potential. We do that by creating groundbreaking sport innovations, by
        making our products more sustainably, by building a creative and diverse
        global team and by making a positive impact in communities where we live
        and work. We strive to keep our work unique and smart, with room for a
        little magic. You can find us in Nairobi, CBD, and if the project is the
        right fit, weâ€™d love to work with you. Feel free to drop us a line,
        here.
